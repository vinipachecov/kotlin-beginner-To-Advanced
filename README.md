# kotlin-beginner-To-Advanced
This is my personal code for the 'Kotlin for Android: Beginner to Advanced' in Udemy.


This has some kotlin and layout code used during this course. Apps developed here are purely educational and not ment to run on production.


# Apps

## DevProfile
This app is a case study for layouts using constraint layouts. It's just a layout for a possible app that would show the projects done by a developer.

* Use of imageviews
* Using different image resolutions to be able to run on devices with different screen resolution 
* Using LandScape and Portrait layouts for both medium and X-Large screen resolutions
